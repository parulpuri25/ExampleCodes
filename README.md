# ExampleCodes
This repo contains Python code of LeetCode Questions solved.

1. Rotate An Array(#Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.)
   
   The approach used to solve this example is to reverse the array completely first. The next step is to reverse the first k elements of the array followed by            reversing the remaining array elements.

2. Find Index Of First Occurrence(#Given two strings s1 and s2, return the index of the first occurrence of s1 in s2, or -1 if s1 is not part of s2.)

   The in operator checks if s1 is a substring of s2. If true, then index method returns the index of first occurrence. If s1 is not a substring -1 is returned.
   
3. Find Minimum Value in a list

   This example finds the minimum value in each list. Using the element at 0th index as the minimum value, a for loop is used to compare it to all other elements of the list and the minimum value is returned.
